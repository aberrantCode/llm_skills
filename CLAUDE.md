## Key Conventions

- **Never delete** from archive — set `status: deprecated` instead
- **Flow direction** is always source → archive; only `/import-skill` reverses this
- **Installed copies** carry `installed-from: llm_skills` frontmatter — skip them during scans
- **Skill bundles** may include optional `sub-skills/` and `commands/` subdirectories
- **All changes** go through feature branch → PR → `dev` (never commit directly to `dev` or `main`)
- **README parity** — every archived skill must have a README row; every row must point to a real file

## Skill Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name:` | yes | unique identifier |
| `description:` | yes | one-line summary |
| `status:` | no | `draft` \| `active` \| `deprecated` — defaults to `active` |
| `version:` | no | semver or ISO date |
| `requires:` | no | list of skill names this skill depends on |
| `installed-from:` | no | set to `llm_skills` on installed copies only |

## Management Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/audit-skills` | Full archive health check (read-only) |
| `/find-skills` | Discover new/changed skills on workstation |
| `/sync-skill <name>` | Archive a skill from its source location |
| `/install-skill <name> <dir>` | Deploy skill bundle to a project |
| `/update-skill` | Update installed skills to archive versions |
| `/import-skill <name>` | Pull project-level changes back to archive |
| `/push-skill <name>` | Push skill bundle to global `~/.claude/skills/` |
| `/search-skill <query>` | Keyword search across archive |
| `/backfill-diagrams` | Generate missing `diagram.html` files |

## Git Workflow

Always use `/ship-to-dev` to merge changes into `dev`, then `/release-to-main` for production releases.

Feature branches: `type/short-description` branching off `dev`, PR back to `dev`.
