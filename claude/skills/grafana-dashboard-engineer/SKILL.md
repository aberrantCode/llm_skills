## Slash Commands

### /new-dashboard [application-name]

**Purpose:** Create a new dashboard from scratch with interactive guidance.

**Prerequisites:**
- Grafana instance running and accessible
- Grafana API key configured (passed via environment or user)
- Datasources (Prometheus, Loki, etc.) pre-configured in Grafana
- Application must be running or have metrics/logs available

**Flow:**
1. Accept application name or system to monitor (e.g., "proxmox", "docker", "emby")
2. Check for existing application template
   - If found: Present template with all available metrics and ask for confirmation
   - If not found: Research via web search + repo inspection, generate comprehensive template
3. Gather requirements via AskUserQuestion:
   - What's the primary use case? (Performance? Availability? Cost? Logs?)
   - Who's the audience? (DevOps, Developers, Executives, On-call?)
   - What dashboard sophistication? (Simple, Comprehensive, Advanced with Alerts, Executive-ready?)
   - Any custom metrics, alert thresholds, or specific drill-downs needed?
   - Refresh cadence and related dashboards in this project?
4. Design dashboard wireframe and present layout options
5. Build dashboard JSON with PromQL/LogQL queries
6. Create feature branch worktree with dashboard definition
7. Test queries against running Grafana instance
8. Generate comprehensive markdown documentation:
   - Extract all metrics and queries from dashboard JSON
   - Document intent, structure, and use cases (from requirement gathering)
   - Create metric definitions with interpretation guidance
   - Generate alert rules table
   - Write usage guide and troubleshooting section
   - Save to `/docs/dashboards/<dashboard-name>.md`
9. Offer deployment to live Grafana for user confirmation

User: /update-dashboard proxmox "add CPU hotspot heatmap, increase alert from 80% to 85%"
Claude: Fetching current dashboard...
Claude: Proposed changes:
  + Add CPU usage heatmap panel (sorted by highest usage)
  ~ Update CPU alert threshold: 80% → 85%
[Shows preview]
User: Looks good
Claude: Testing queries in live Grafana... ✅ All valid
Ready to deploy?
```

### /remove-dashboard [dashboard-name]

   - Related exports/backups
3. Ask for confirmation with impact details
4. Remove from repo, commit change
5. Delete from live Grafana instance
6. Archive backup in `.archive/` directory
7. Generate cleanup summary

**Example:**
```
User: /remove-dashboard old-test-dashboard
Claude: Found "old-test-dashboard" in repo and Grafana.
Claude: Impact:
  - 2 alert rules (will become orphaned)
  - Reference in README.md
  - 1 backup created
Confirm deletion?
User: Yes

Summary: 16 panels, 14 queries, 2 alerts | Last updated: 3 days ago
```

### /list-dashboards [--filter application|status|category]

**Purpose:** Inventory all dashboards with health status and metadata.

**Output:**
- Dashboard name and application/category
- Status (✅ valid, ⚠️ warnings, 🔴 errors, 🔄 drift detected)
- Panel/query/alert counts
- Last modified date
- Owner (if applicable)

**Filters:**
```
/list-dashboards                           # All dashboards
/list-dashboards --filter application:proxmox  # Only Proxmox
/list-dashboards --filter status:warning   # Dashboards with warnings

## Application Templates

The skill maintains a searchable library of application-specific monitoring templates. Each template documents:
- All possible metrics for that application
- Recommended dashboard layouts and hierarchies
- Best-practice PromQL/LogQL queries with explanations
- Alert threshold recommendations (dev vs prod)
- Links to official documentation
- Community examples and use cases

### Template Discovery Workflow

**When user requests `/new-dashboard [appname]`:**

1. **Search local templates** — Check `<repo>/.claude/skills/grafana-dashboard-engineer/` for `[APPNAME].md`
2. **If found** → Present template to user with metric categories for selection
3. **If not found** → Research phase:
   - Web search official docs, Grafana community, GitHub
   - Inspect repo for existing configs/deployments of that application
   - Query running application's metrics endpoint (if accessible)
4. **Generate comprehensive template** covering all available metrics
5. **Present wireframe to user** for feedback and customization
6. **Create template file** `[APPNAME].md` for future reuse

#### Documentation Generation Workflow

When running `/new-dashboard` or `/update-dashboard`:

1. **Gather Intent Information** via AskUserQuestion:
   - Primary use case and audience
   - Refresh cadence and expected users
   - Related dashboards in the project
2. **Extract Metrics from Dashboard JSON**:
   - Parse all PromQL/LogQL queries
   - Identify metric names and units
   - Determine alert thresholds
3. **Generate Metric Definitions Section**:
   - For each metric, document:
     - The PromQL/LogQL query used
     - Unit of measurement
     - What it measures and why it matters
     - Interpretation guidance (healthy vs critical ranges)
     - Common causes when values are concerning
     - Action items for remediation
4. **Create Alert Rules Table**:
   - Extract all alert conditions
   - Organize by severity and metric
   - Document trigger thresholds and durations
5. **Write Usage Guide**:
   - Explain logical flow through dashboard
   - Common questions and troubleshooting
   - Links to related dashboards
6. **Save to `/docs/dashboards/`**:
   - File naming: `<dashboard-name>.md` (same as JSON file, different extension)
   - Include full frontmatter with metadata
   - Always sync with dashboard updates

#### Keeping Documentation in Sync

- Whenever `/update-dashboard` modifies queries, thresholds, or panels:
  1. Update corresponding `.md` file with new metric definitions
  2. Add changelog entry at bottom
  3. Update `last_modified` date in frontmatter
- Documentation is version-controlled alongside dashboard JSON
- Documentation and dashboard JSON should never drift

```powershell
# Deploy Windows Exporter and Grafana dashboard for Windows monitoring
param(
    [string]$GrafanaUrl = "https://grafana.example.com",
    [string]$GrafanaApiKey = $env:GRAFANA_API_KEY,
    [string]$ExporterVersion = "0.21.0"
)

function Install-WindowsExporter {
    param([string]$Version)
    
    $DownloadUrl = "https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter/releases/download/v$Version/windows_exporter-$Version-amd64.exe"
    $InstallerPath = "$env:TEMP\windows_exporter-$Version-amd64.exe"
    
    Write-Host "Downloading Windows Exporter v$Version..."
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $DownloadUrl -OutFile $InstallerPath
    
    Write-Host "Installing Windows Exporter..."

## Best Practices Encoded

The skill enforces and teaches industry-standard observability practices:

### 1. Query Optimization
- Recommend `rate()` for counter metrics (avoid raw counters)
- Suggest appropriate time ranges (5m, 15m, 1h based on metric frequency)
- Flag N+1 query patterns and label explosion
- Optimize cardinality in label matching (avoid high-cardinality labels)

### 2. Alert Thresholds
- Base recommendations on industry standards (USE, RED methods)
- Suggest different thresholds for dev vs prod environments
- Warn about overly aggressive thresholds (alert fatigue)
- Include runbook links with each alert rule
- Recommend SLO-based alerting for critical services

### 3. Dashboard UX/Design
- Logical panel ordering (top-left = most important metric)
- Consistent color schemes (green=healthy, amber=warning, red=critical)
- Readable panel titles and descriptions with units
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Meaningful drill-down paths (panels linking to related dashboards)

### 4. Documentation
- Explain each panel's purpose and how to interpret it
- Document custom variables and their impact
- Link to related dashboards
- Include alert runbooks and escalation paths
- Document when dashboard was last verified

### 5. Monitoring Methodologies
- **RED method** for services: Rate (requests/sec), Errors (error rate %), Duration (latency)
- **USE method** for infrastructure: Utilization (%), Saturation (queue depth), Errors (error count)
- **SLO/SLA tracking** for critical systems
- **Proactive alerting** (alert on trends, not just thresholds)
- **Cost tracking** where applicable (compute hours, data egress, etc.)

---

## Integration with Your Infrastructure

The skill is aware of your environment from the repository:
- Existing deployments (Proxmox, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Git history patterns (identifies infrastructure changes)
- Application configurations (uses to inform metric selection)
- Current monitoring gaps (suggests dashboards for unmonitored systems)

**When you run `/new-dashboard [app]`, the skill will:**
1. Search repo for existing configs/deployments of that application
2. Check git history for relevant patterns and changes
3. Propose monitoring aligned with your actual infrastructure
4. Suggest complementary dashboards (e.g., "Add OPNsense network metrics to complement Proxmox monitoring?")

## Example Workflows

### Scenario 1: Adding EMBY Media Server Dashboard

```
User: /new-dashboard emby
Claude: Searching for EMBY template... Not found. Researching...
Claude: Found EMBY in your docker-compose. Generating template...
Claude: Here's what we can monitor for EMBY:
  □ Playback stats (users, concurrent streams, content)
  □ Server performance (CPU, memory, cache efficiency)
  □ Library health (file counts, organization, errors)
  □ Transcoding load (concurrent sessions, CPU cost)
User: All, especially transcoding
Claude: Few quick questions...
  - Who uses this dashboard? (You, other family members, support team?)
  - What's most important? (Performance? Availability? Cost?)
Claude: Building EMBY dashboard with transcoding focus...
[Creates worktree, generates JSON, tests in live Grafana]
Claude: Preview ready. This shows transcoding activity, library stats, and performance.
User: Perfect, deploy it
Claude: Dashboard deployed. Ready to ship to dev?
User: Yes
[Creates PR with dashboard + docs, merges after approval]
```

### Scenario 2: Optimizing Proxmox Dashboard After Incident

```
User: /update-dashboard proxmox "add network I/O per VM, CPU alert was 95% but we hit limits at 85%"
Claude: Fetching current dashboard...
Claude: Proposed changes:
  + Add network I/O heatmap (sorted by usage)
  ~ Lower CPU alert from 95% to 85%
Claude: Testing queries in live Grafana... ✅ Valid
User: Deploy
[Deploys to live Grafana]
User: Looks good
Claude: Shipping to dev...
[Creates PR with change explanation and test results]
```

### Scenario 3: Discovering Monitoring Gaps

```
User: /list-dashboards --filter status:warning
Claude: Found 2 dashboards with warnings:

1. docker-containers ⚠️ Loki query failing
2. opnsense-firewall ⚠️ Drift detected (3 live changes)

User: /audit-dashboard opnsense-firewall
Claude: Auditing OPNsense dashboard...
🔴 3 live edits not in repo (drift detected)
⚠️ Missing WAN interface packet loss tracking
⚠️ CPU alert threshold might be too high
Claude: Want to fix these?
User: Yes, add WAN tracking
Claude: Building update...
[Updates dashboard, deploys, ships to dev]
```

✅ **Good fit:**
- Creating new Grafana dashboards
- Updating existing dashboards with new metrics
- Designing observability for applications
- Investigating monitoring gaps and blind spots
- Optimizing alert thresholds after incidents
- Documenting monitoring strategy
- Deploying dashboards via IaC

❌ **Not this skill:**
- General Grafana administration (user/org management, permissions)
- Datasource configuration (assume datasources exist and are accessible)
- Incident response triage (use for observability insights, not incident response)
- Log analysis tools (this is dashboard engineering, not log forensics)

## Quick Start Checklist

Before using this skill:

- [ ] Grafana instance running and accessible at a URL
- [ ] Grafana API key obtained (service account token recommended)
- [ ] Datasources configured (Prometheus, Loki, etc. as needed)
- [ ] Application running or metrics/logs being collected
- [ ] Repository writable for storing dashboards and docs
- [ ] Environment variables set: `GRAFANA_URL`, `GRAFANA_API_KEY`

**Example setup:**
```bash
export GRAFANA_URL="https://grafana.example.com"
export GRAFANA_API_KEY="glsa_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# Then: /new-dashboard proxmox
```

## Future Extensions

- Dashboard versioning and rollback to previous versions
- Multi-Grafana instance support (sync dashboards across environments)
- Dashboard sharing registry (community-contributed templates)
- Custom alert notification templates per dashboard
- SLO/SLI calculation helpers with burn rate tracking
- Cost attribution dashboards (cloud spend, compute hours)
- ML-based anomaly detection integration
- Dashboard performance profiling (slow queries, heavy panels)
- Auto-remediation for common misconfiguration patterns
