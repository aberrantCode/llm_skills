  Automated project implementation orchestrator that drives feature-driven development from a single
  initial prompt through to completed code. Use this skill when the user invokes /continue-tasks,
  /review-tasks, /update-tasks, /init-features, or /reinit. Also trigger proactively when
  docs/INITIAL_PROMPT.md exists and the user says anything like "move forward", "keep building",
  "what's next", "continue the implementation", or "start working on the project". This skill
  manages the full lifecycle: extracting feature specs via interview, generating phased implementation
  plans, spawning typed agents to execute tasks, monitoring completion sentinels, recovering from
  failures, and archiving finished work — all driven by markdown files that act as the shared state
  between orchestrator and worker agents.

# Project Manager Skill

This skill implements a self-driving project pipeline. Markdown files in `docs/` are the single
source of truth — they persist across sessions and coordinate between the orchestrator (you) and
worker agents.

## Directory Conventions

```
docs/
  INITIAL_PROMPT.md          # Source of truth for product intent (never modified)
  features/                  # Feature specs — final authority on scope
    {feature-slug}.md
  plans/                     # One plan per feature spec
    {feature-slug}-plan.md
  tasks/                     # Active task files (one at a time per phase)
    active/
      {feature-slug}-p{N}-t{M}.md
    archive/
      {feature-slug}-p{N}-t{M}.md
  guides/                    # Supporting docs, architecture notes (optional)
  issues/                    # Logged failures and blockers
```

Read `references/feature-spec-template.md`, `references/plan-template.md`, and
`references/task-file-template.md` for the exact file formats to use.

## Commands

### `/continue-tasks` — Full Orchestration Loop

This is the main driver. It runs the complete pipeline end-to-end.

**Step 1 — Bootstrap check**
Check whether `docs/features/` contains any `.md` files.
- If **empty**: run the Feature Interview (see below) before proceeding.
- If **partial** (some features have no plan yet): offer the user a choice — complete the interview
  for remaining features first, or proceed with existing specs.
- If **complete**: skip to Step 2.

**Step 2 — Plan generation**
For each feature spec that does not yet have a matching plan in `docs/plans/`:
- Read the feature spec
- Generate a phased plan (see plan template) and write it to `docs/plans/{feature-slug}-plan.md`
- Plans must include: phases, task list per phase, role/agent-type per task, expected outcome, and
  a status column (todo / in-progress / done / blocked)

**Step 3 — Find next task**
Scan all plan files for the first task with status `todo`. Pick the highest-priority incomplete
task (earlier phase > earlier feature alphabetically).

If no `todo` tasks remain: report "All plans complete." and stop.

**Step 4 — Write task file**
Create `docs/tasks/active/{feature-slug}-p{N}-t{M}.md` using the task file template. Include:
- The full task description and expected outcome from the plan
- Relevant context: feature spec excerpt, plan phase goals, any related completed tasks
- The completion sentinel instructions (agent must write `## Completion` at the bottom)

Update the plan: mark the task as `in-progress`.

**Step 5 — Select and spawn agent**
Map the task's `role` field to an agent type using this table:

| Role | Agent Type |
|---|---|
| `architecture`, `design`, `planning` | `planner` |
| `feature`, `implementation`, `api` | `tdd-guide` |
| `review`, `quality` | `code-reviewer` |
| `security` | `security-reviewer` |
| `build`, `types`, `errors` | `build-error-resolver` |
| `e2e`, `testing` | `e2e-runner` |
| `docs`, `documentation` | `doc-updater` |
| `cleanup`, `refactor` | `refactor-cleaner` |
| anything else | `general-purpose` |

Spawn the agent with the task file path and this instruction:
> "Read the task file at `{path}`. Perform all actions described. When complete, append a
> `## Completion` sentinel to the task file exactly as specified in the template. Do not delete or
> modify any existing content above the sentinel."

**Step 6 — Monitor completion**
Poll the task file for the presence of a `## Completion` heading. When found:

- Read the sentinel block for `Status:` field
- If **success**: archive the task file (move to `docs/tasks/archive/`), update plan task to `done`,
  log any notes from the sentinel into the plan, then return to Step 3.
- If **failure**: enter the **Error Recovery Loop** (see below).

---

### Error Recovery Loop (up to 5 iterations)

When a task fails, do NOT retry the same task blindly. Instead:

1. Read the failure message from the sentinel's `Error:` field.
2. Diagnose the root cause — what is missing that would allow this task to succeed?
3. Add 1–3 corrective tasks to the plan *before* the failed task (or as prerequisites):
   - Give them role assignments appropriate to the correction needed
   - Mark the original failed task back to `todo`
4. Increment the failure counter on the plan (stored in a `failures:` frontmatter field).
5. If `failures` < 5: return to Step 3 (the corrective tasks will be picked up next).
6. If `failures` >= 5: **pause the loop**, write a detailed issue file to `docs/issues/`, report
   to the user what has been tried and ask how to proceed. Do not continue automatically.

---

### `/review-tasks` — Dry-Run Analysis (no agents spawned)

Produce a read-only status report. Do not modify any files.

1. Count feature specs in `docs/features/`
2. Count plans in `docs/plans/` and identify specs missing a plan
3. For each plan: count tasks by status (todo / in-progress / done / blocked)
4. List any active task files in `docs/tasks/active/`
5. List any open issues in `docs/issues/`
6. Output a structured markdown report showing:
   - Overall completion percentage
   - Per-feature progress table
   - Next recommended action

This command is safe to run at any time to get a project snapshot.

---

### `/update-tasks` — Sync Active Task Files

Use this when you suspect task agents have completed work but the plan hasn't been updated yet.

1. Read every file in `docs/tasks/active/`
2. For each file, check for a `## Completion` sentinel
3. If found:
   - Parse the `Status:` and `Summary:` fields
   - Update the corresponding plan task status
   - Archive the task file
   - Log any notes
4. Report what was updated

This command is idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

---

### `/reinit` — Archive Legacy State, Normalize Specs, Then Launch

Use when starting the orchestration loop on a project that has existing (possibly non-conforming)
plans, tasks, and feature specs — e.g., after manual planning work, importing legacy docs, or
recovering from an inconsistent state. Produces a clean slate conforming to the directory
conventions, then immediately runs `/continue-tasks`.

**Step 1 — Archive existing plans**
Move every file in `docs/plans/` (non-archive) to `docs/plans/archive/`. Create
`docs/plans/archive/` if it doesn't exist. If a filename collision would occur, prefix the
destination with today's date (`YYYY-MM-DD-`). Do not delete any files.

**Step 2 — Archive existing tasks**
Move every file currently in `docs/tasks/active/` to `docs/tasks/archive/`. Move any loose
task files sitting directly in `docs/tasks/` (not in a subdirectory) to `docs/tasks/archive/`
as well. Do not delete any files.

**Step 3 — Normalize feature specs**
For each `.md` file in `docs/features/` that is not `README.md` and not `template.md`:

1. Read the file in full.
2. Check whether it has the required YAML frontmatter block with all fields:
   `feature`, `slug`, `status`, `priority`, `area`, `depends_on`, `last_updated`.
3. Check whether it has all required sections:
   `## Overview`, `## Capabilities`, `## Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Out of Scope`.
4. If **fully conforming**: mark as `ok`, skip.
5. If **non-conforming**: rewrite the file using the template structure. Rules:
   - **Never discard content.** Every sentence, table, list, code block, and edge-case note from
     the original must appear somewhere in the rewritten file.
   - Map existing content to the nearest matching section. If it doesn't fit cleanly into any
     required section, place it in a `## Notes` section at the bottom.
   - Infer missing frontmatter fields from the file's content and filename:
     - `slug` → derive from filename (strip `.md`)
     - `status` → look for a `Status` field in a `## Metadata` table or similar; default `draft`
     - `priority` → look for explicit priority signal; default `p2`
     - `area` → infer from the feature name or existing metadata
     - `depends_on` → look for dependency references in the text; default `[]`
     - `last_updated` → today's date
   - Keep the `## Capabilities` section as a checklist (`- [ ] ...`), promoting bullet lists
     from the original where needed.
   - Keep `## Acceptance Criteria` as Given/When/Then bullets where possible.
6. After rewriting, report the file as `normalized`.

Report a summary table when done:

| File | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| auth.md | ok | already conforming |
| property-data-model.md | normalized | added frontmatter, remapped Metadata table |

**Step 4 — Launch**
Run `/continue-tasks` from Step 1 (bootstrap check).

## Feature Interview

Run this when `docs/features/` is empty or when new features need to be captured.

### Step 1 — Extract feature areas from the prompt
Read `docs/INITIAL_PROMPT.md`. Group the implied features into 3–6 functional areas (e.g., "Data
Models & Engine", "Onboarding & Profiles", "Dashboard & Logging", "Planner & Visualization",
"Recovery & Reminders"). List the areas to the user and ask if the grouping makes sense before
proceeding.

### Step 2 — Interview one area at a time
For each area, use the AskUserQuestion tool to collect:
- Which capabilities in this area are must-have vs. nice-to-have
- Any constraints or non-obvious requirements not captured in the prompt
- Acceptance criteria: what does "done" look like for this area?
- Known dependencies on other areas

After each area interview, immediately write the feature spec(s) to `docs/features/`. Do not batch
writes — specs are useful immediately and the user may stop at any time.

### Step 3 — Feature spec format
Read `references/feature-spec-template.md` for the exact format. Key fields:
- `status`: `draft` | `approved` | `implemented`
- `priority`: `p1` | `p2` | `p3`
- Capabilities list (what the feature can do)
- Requirements (must/should/may)
- Acceptance criteria (testable, binary pass/fail)
- Out-of-scope (explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep)

### Spec Authority Rule
Feature specs are the final authority on scope. They may only be changed by:
1. The user directly editing the file
2. An agent that has used AskUserQuestion to confirm the change with the user

Never silently update a spec during implementation to match what was built. If an implementation
diverges from a spec, pause and surface the discrepancy.

---

## Working Principles

**One task at a time.** The orchestration loop processes tasks serially. Parallel execution of tasks
in the same feature creates merge conflicts and makes failure harder to diagnose.

**Plans are living checklists.** A plan file is both the specification and the progress tracker.
When reading a plan, the status column tells you exactly where things stand.

**Task files carry full context.** An agent should be able to read only its task file and perform
the work correctly. Do not rely on agents having prior session context — embed all relevant excerpts
from specs and plans into the task file.

**Archive aggressively.** Completed task files move immediately to `archive/`. The `active/`
directory should contain at most one file per active work stream.

**Specs before plans, plans before tasks.** Never generate a task for a feature without an approved
spec. Never spawn an agent for a task that isn't in a plan. The pipeline flows in one direction.
