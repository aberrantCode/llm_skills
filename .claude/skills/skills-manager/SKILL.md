  Full lifecycle management of LLM skills across the workstation — finding, archiving,
  installing, updating, and importing skills with their complete bundles (sub-skills +
  companion commands). Use when the user invokes /find-skills, /sync-skill, /install-skill,
  /update-skill, or /import-skill. All user interaction MUST go through the AskUserQuestion
  tool — never free-form text, never inline markdown questions.

# Skills Manager

You are the domain expert for the LLM Skills Archive at `C:\development\llm_skills`. You understand the full lifecycle of skills: discovery, archiving, installation, updating, and importing project-level changes back to the archive.

**Critical constraint:** Every question or confirmation to the user MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Never prompt via free text, never write "Type yes/no", never use inline markdown questions.

---

## Core Concepts

### Archive
`C:\development\llm_skills` is the single source of truth for all LLM skills, agents, and commands. It consolidates skills from the global Claude profile (`~/.claude/`) and all projects under `C:\development\`.

### Skill Bundle
A skill directory may contain optional subdirectories that travel with it:

```
claude/skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill
├── sub-skills/           # Thin delegate skills that extend this skill
│   └── <sub-name>/SKILL.md
└── commands/             # Slash-command dispatchers for this skill system
    └── <cmd>.md
```

Deploying a bundle to a repo copies:
- `SKILL.md` → `<target>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Each `sub-skills/<sub>/SKILL.md` → `<target>/.claude/skills/<sub>/SKILL.md`
- Each `commands/<cmd>.md` → `<target>/.claude/commands/<cmd>.md`

### Installed Copy
A skill file with `installed-from: llm_skills` in its YAML frontmatter is an installed copy from the archive. The sync and find operations skip these — they are not project-developed skills.

### Source Priority (conflict resolution)
When the same skill name exists in multiple sources, the highest-priority source wins:
1. Global profile (`~/.claude/`)
2. This repo's `.claude/` folder
3. Other projects under `C:\development\` (alphabetical for determinism)

### Companion Command Detection
When scanning a project, a `.md` file in `.claude/commands/` is a companion to skill `X` if its body matches (case-insensitive):
```
Invoke the `[anything containing X]` skill
```
or uses `X:*` namespace notation.

### Sub-Skill Detection
A `SKILL.md` whose body is primarily a delegation (`Invoke the \`X\` skill and execute...`) is a sub-skill of `X`. It belongs in `X`'s `sub-skills/` bundle directory.

## Operation: /find-skills [path]

Discover skills across the workstation that are new or changed relative to the archive. Read-only — makes no changes.

### Steps

1. Determine scan scope:
   - If `path` argument given: scan only that directory
   - If no argument: use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before scanning:
     - Question: "Scan all source locations for new or changed skills?"
     - Options: "Yes, scan everything" | "Cancel"
     - Proceed only on confirm

2. For each discovered `SKILL.md`:
   - Read frontmatter — if `installed-from: llm_skills` is present, **skip** (installed copy)
   - Compare content against archive counterpart using diff (ignore trailing whitespace)
   - Classify: **New** | **Changed** | **Unchanged** | **Orphan**

3. For each New or Changed skill: also search the same project's `.claude/commands/` for companion commands using the detection heuristic.

4. Output a structured report:
   ```
   ┌─ Skills Manager: Find Report ──────────────────┐
   │ New (N):     skill-a, skill-b                  │
   │ Changed (N): skill-c                           │
   │ Unchanged:   N skills skipped                  │
   │ Orphans:     N archive-only skills             │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```
   For each New/Changed skill, list any detected companion commands beneath it.

---

## Operation: /sync-skill [name]

Archive a specific skill (or all discovered skills) including its full bundle.

### With a skill name

1. Search all canonical source locations for a skill named `name` (match by leaf directory name)
2. Skip any match where `installed-from: llm_skills` is in frontmatter
3. Apply conflict resolution if multiple sources found — take highest-priority source
4. Detect companion commands and sub-skills in the same project (see heuristics above)
5. Write to archive:
   - `SKILL.md` → `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - Companion commands → `claude/skills/<name>/commands/<cmd>.md`
   - Sub-skills → `claude/skills/<name>/sub-skills/<sub>/SKILL.md`
6. Generate a visual diagram for the skill:
   - Invoke the `visual-explainer:generate-web-diagram` skill
   - Instruct it to diagram: the skill's purpose (from `description` frontmatter), its key operations or phases (from section headings), significant inputs/outputs, and any decision points or branching paths
   - Save the resulting HTML to `claude/skills/<name>/diagram.html`
   - Add or update a `## Diagram` section at the bottom of `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (before any final horizontal rule) containing exactly: `[View diagram](diagram.html)`
7. Update README: add row if new, update description if `description` frontmatter changed; include diagram link (see README Update Rules)
8. Report what was written

### Without a skill name

1. Run the /find-skills scan internally (no user prompt for the scan itself) to enumerate scope
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
   - Question: "Sync all N new/changed skills? (list skill names)"
   - Options: "Yes, sync all" | "Cancel"
3. Proceed only on confirm; process each New and Changed skill in turn

### README Update Rules (sync)
- New skill: extract `description` from frontmatter, classify subsection (see heuristics), insert alphabetically within subsection, mark `✓` in correct toolset column, increment counts
- Changed skill: update Description cell only if frontmatter `description` changed; do not move the row
- Bundled commands: document on the skill's row as `— ships with /cmd1, /cmd2`; do NOT add standalone rows for them in the Commands table
- Sub-skills in bundles: do NOT list as standalone rows; implied by parent skill row
- **Diagram link**: every skill row that has a `diagram.html` in its archive directory must include a diagram link in the Skill column cell, formatted as: `` [`<name>`](claude/skills/<name>/) [(diagram)](claude/skills/<name>/diagram.html) ``
- Never delete from archive; never remove rows

---

## Operation: /install-skill [name] [target-dir]

Deploy a skill bundle from the archive into a project.

### Steps

1. **Determine scope:**
   - If `name` given: install that skill only
   - If no `name`: enumerate all skills in `claude/skills/` that have not already been installed in `target-dir`; use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
     - Question: "Install all N available skills into `<target>`? This will write N files."
     - Options: "Yes, install all" | "Cancel"
     - Proceed only on confirm

2. For a named skill: locate `claude/skills/<name>/` in the archive; if not found use `AskUserQuestion`:
   - Question: "Skill `<name>` not found in archive. Check the name and try again."
   - Options: "OK" | "List available skills"

3. If `target-dir` not provided, use `AskUserQuestion`:
   - Question: "Where should the skill(s) be installed?"
   - Options: "Current project directory" | "Other path (specify below)"

4. Inventory what will be installed per skill:
   - `SKILL.md` (1 file)
   - Sub-skills from `sub-skills/` (N files)
   - Commands from `commands/` (N files)

5. If `name` was given, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
   - Question: "Install `<name>` into `<target>`? This will write N files."
   - Options: "Yes, install" | "Cancel"

6. On confirm:
   - Write `<target>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; inject `installed-from: llm_skills` into frontmatter (add after existing fields)
   - Write each sub-skill to `<target>/.claude/skills/<sub>/SKILL.md` with same marker
   - Write each command to `<target>/.claude/commands/<cmd>.md` (no marker — commands are not skills)

7. Report all files written

---

## Operation: /update-skill [name]

Update installed skills in the current project when the archive has newer versions.

### Steps

1. Scan current project's `.claude/skills/` for files with `installed-from: llm_skills` in frontmatter
2. If `name` given: filter to that skill only

3. For each installed skill found:
   - Compare content against archive version
   - If identical: skip (no update needed)
   - If archive is newer: record as outdated

4. **Confirm scope** with `AskUserQuestion` before touching anything:
   - If updating all: "Update all N outdated skills? (list skill names)"
   - If updating one by name: "Update `<name>` to the archive version?"
   - Options: "Yes, update" | "Cancel"

5. On confirm:
   - Overwrite each `SKILL.md`, preserving the `installed-from: llm_skills` marker in frontmatter
   - Also check `commands/` in the archive bundle — write any new or changed commands to `<project>/.claude/commands/`
   - Also check `sub-skills/` — update any installed sub-skills that are outdated
   - Regenerate the diagram: invoke `visual-explainer:generate-web-diagram` for each updated skill and overwrite `claude/skills/<name>/diagram.html`; update the `## Diagram` section in SKILL.md if the path changed

6. Report updated files

---

## Operation: /import-skill [name]

Import project-level changes to a skill back into the archive and the global user profile.

### Steps

1. **Determine scope:**
   - If `name` given: import that skill only
   - If no `name`: scan current project's `.claude/skills/` for all skills that do NOT have `installed-from: llm_skills` and differ from the archive; use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
     - Question: "Import all N project-developed skills to archive and user profile? (list names)"
     - Options: "Yes, import all" | "Cancel"
     - Proceed only on confirm

2. Locate `<name>/SKILL.md` in the current project's `.claude/skills/`
3. Check frontmatter: if `installed-from: llm_skills` is present, use `AskUserQuestion` to reject:
   - Question: "`<name>` was installed from the archive — it is not a project-developed skill. Import would just overwrite the archive with its own content. Proceed anyway?"
   - Options: "Cancel" | "Yes, force import"
   - Default is Cancel; only proceed if user explicitly chooses force

3. Diff current project version against archive version
4. Show summary: lines added, lines removed, key description change (if any)

5. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
   - Question: "Import `<name>` changes to archive and user profile? (N lines added, N removed)"
   - Options: "Yes, import both" | "Archive only" | "Cancel"

6. On confirm:
   - **Archive**: overwrite `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - **User profile**: overwrite `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (create dir if needed)
   - **Companion commands**: scan project `.claude/commands/` for new companion commands not yet in the archive bundle; for each new one, use `AskUserQuestion`: "Bundle `/<cmd>` with `<name>`?" → "Yes" | "Skip"
   - **README**: update Description cell if frontmatter `description` changed

7. Report what was imported

## Source Discovery Table

| Source | Path Pattern | Toolset | Archive Destination |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| Global profile | `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Claude | `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Global profile | `~/.claude/agents/*.md` | Claude | `claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| Global profile | `~/.claude/commands/*.md` | Claude | `claude/commands/<name>.md` |
| This repo | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Claude | `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| This repo | `.claude/commands/*.md` | Claude | `claude/commands/<name>.md` |
| Other projects | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Claude | `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Other projects | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Claude | `claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| Other projects | `.claude/commands/*.md` | Claude | `claude/commands/<name>.md` |
| Other projects | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Claude | `claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Other projects | `codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Codex | `codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Other projects | `gemini/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Gemini | `gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

**Nested paths**: The skill `<name>` is always the leaf directory containing `SKILL.md`. Intermediate path segments (e.g. `homeradar/` in `skills/homeradar/feature-start/SKILL.md`) are discarded.

**Installed-copy filter**: Apply before any classification. Skip any file with `installed-from: llm_skills` in frontmatter.

**`llm_skills` itself**: Only scan `.claude/` — never recurse into `claude/` (the archive destination). Scanning the archive as a source would create circular copies.

**Directories to skip**: `nul`, `emby-opbta.p12`, `fullchain.pem`, `privkey.pem`, `recovery_app`, and any loose files (not directories) at the `C:\development\` root.

## README Classification Heuristics

Infer subsection from keywords in the skill's `description` field:

| Keywords | Subsection |
|----------|-----------|
| git, branch, commit, PR, merge, workflow, session, team, coordination, repo | Foundations & Workflow |
| TypeScript, Python, Node.js, runtime, language | Languages & Runtimes |
| React, Vue, Next.js, frontend framework, PWA, Flutter | Frontend Frameworks |
| Android, iOS, mobile native, Kotlin, Swift | Mobile (Native) |
| UI, UX, design, Tailwind, accessibility, visual, diagram, explainer | UI & Design |
| database, SQL, Supabase, Firebase, DynamoDB, Aurora, Cosmos, D1, schema | Databases & Storage |
| code review, testing, quality, lint, coverage, Playwright, duplication | Code Quality |
| security, credentials, auth, OWASP, secrets, vulnerability | Security & Credentials |
| AI, LLM, agent, prompt, model, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini | AI & LLM |
| commerce, Shopify, WooCommerce, Medusa, Stripe, payment | Commerce & Payments |
| Klaviyo, Reddit, Teams, PostHog, third-party, integration | Third-Party Integrations |
| SEO, sitemap, robots, web presence, content, GEO | SEO & Web Presence |
| tooling, DevOps, CLI, deploy, Vercel, render, CI/CD | Tooling & DevOps |
| OSINT, research, intelligence, GEOINT, worldview, forensics | Research & OSINT |

If no keywords match: **Uncategorized**. Multiple matches: most keyword hits wins; break ties with more specific subsection.

## Archive Invariants — Never Violate

1. **Never delete from archive.** Even if a source file no longer exists, the archive copy stays. Deletions are manual curatorial decisions.
2. **Flow is always source → archive** — except `/import-skill`, which explicitly reverses this.
3. **The archive README is the authoritative index.** Every archived skill must have a row; every row must point to a real file.
4. **Toolset is determined by directory, not content.**
5. **Installed copies are not project-developed skills.** The `installed-from: llm_skills` marker gates this distinction.
